                <h3>Do you charge extra for meeting to plan the music?</h3>
            </header>

                <h3>Do we have to hire your accompanists?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Nope! I have worked with many musicians in Portland and have found a great group of people I like to work with. If you have specific musicians in mind, let me know! I'm always willing to work with new musicians. My fee will always be the same, but other musicians I use may change their fees depending on the length of the event. Before I hire other musicians for your event, I will always run the numbers by you.</p>
