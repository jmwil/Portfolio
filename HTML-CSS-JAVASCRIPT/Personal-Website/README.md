### Personal website
***


Here is some code snippets from my personal website. The full website can be found at www.jimmywilcox.com. It is a simplistic and modern landing page that functions beautifully on every screen size.

I created my website using Google's Material Design concepts with current HTML5/CSS3 standards and some simple/elegant Javascript animations as well as a few JQuery plugins. I also learned a quick bit of PHP to create my contact form at the bottom of the page.
