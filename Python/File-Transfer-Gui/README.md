### Datetime Drill
***

This scenario was split up into 3 different drills. The code included is my finished application that came from all three prompts.

1) Once per day, any files that are new or have been modified in the last 24 hours must be transferred to another file destination. Create a folder that stores all new and modified documents and a destination folder to receive said documents. Write a script that will automatically move modified and new files from the working folder to the destination folder once per day.

2) Expand on the part 1 by creating a GUI so the script is easier to interact with and more versatile. Allow the user to choose a specific working folder, a specific destination folder, and manually update the 'file check' process. Complete this using Python 2.7, wxPython, and IDLE.

3) Finally, add database functionality to store data on when each 'file check' process has occured so the user can see when the last 'file check' took place.
