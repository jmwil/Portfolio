### Datetime Drill
***

For the scenario in this drill, the company I work for just opened up two new branches, one in New York City and the other in London. The hours of both of the branches are from 9:00am - 9:00pm in their respective time zones.

I was asked to create a program that will compare the times of the branches and let you know when each branch is open or closed. I created this program using Python 2.7, IDLE, and the Datetime module.
